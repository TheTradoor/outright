# Native integration verification

Local verification completed on 12 November 2026. These results apply to the
native integration change and the pinned sources below. They are not results
from a deployed market or an independent audit.

## Sources and toolchains

| Item | Revision or version |
| --- | --- |
| Outright base commit | `951c2f63fb66dacb841cec973e43172d45da892a` |
| Percolator engine baseline | `b22bef7d6122fd7d82680ce9859e8b77fd8ef656` |
| Percolator Solana wrapper | `b42fe017c2bc953778f90d0cb85cd1d426b6e783` |
| Node.js | 24.22.1 |
| Host conformance and engine tests | Rust 1.100.0 |
| Legacy SVM host fixture | Rust 1.95.0 |
| SBF builder | cargo-build-sbf 4.6.0 |
| SBF platform tools and target | v1.52, SBPF v0 |

The engine source, manifest, lockfile, specification, and Cargo configuration
match the engine baseline. The host exporter uses this checkout's engine. The
SBF wrapper uses the identical pinned upstream engine source. Its checkout was
clean before and after the test runner.

## Results

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test --locked` | 293 passed |
| `cargo test --locked --features fuzz` | 357 passed |
| `bash protocol/check.sh` | Source check and Rust contract comparison passed; 58 JavaScript tests passed |
| `bash protocol/svm/run.sh ../percolator-prog` | 3 SBF integration tests passed |
| Engine comparison with baseline | No differences |
| Revised documentation links and `git diff --check` | Passed |

The default and fuzz-feature runs overlap. Their counts are not additive.
The Rust exporter reproduces the checked-in instruction and account-layout
fixtures without changes.

The SBF tests cover initialization, deposit, open, partial reduction, close,
and withdrawal. Rejection cases cover stale sequence and position epoch,
incorrect portfolio and market identities, unauthorized ownership, excessive
withdrawal, and a missing counterparty signature. Each rejection is checked
against its exact error and failing instruction index, with unchanged market,
portfolio, and SPL accounts.

The bundled-transaction test first executes a deposit and then fails an
excessive withdrawal. The failure at the second program instruction confirms
that the first instruction ran. All observed account changes, including the
SPL transfer and portfolio sequence, roll back.

## Locally tested artifacts

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `percolator_prog.so` | `d2a05d0e9f578384e740db289f8539688cd0b36ab3ae848558fa24ab258257a4` |
| `auth_matcher.so` | `50e532267926e180f013200c1799e26127dd23dc150866cffd491424629ddf93` |

These hashes identify the local test binaries. They are not public deployment
addresses or a claim of reproducibility across build environments. The matcher
fixture is loaded by the upstream harness but matcher execution is not tested
by this lifecycle.

The measured compute units were 27,874 for initialization, 38,098 for deposit,
126,785 for open, 138,387 for partial reduction, 123,193 for close, and 38,986
for withdrawal. These measurements describe this small fixed-price fixture,
not worst-case production limits.

## Remaining verification

Nonzero fees and funding, changing or stale oracle inputs, liquidation,
insolvency, matcher execution, and recovery require additional transaction
coverage. Current-cluster compatibility, funded liquidity, wallet flows,
service recovery, deployment verification, and independent security review
remain release requirements. Full Kani verification was not run for this change.
